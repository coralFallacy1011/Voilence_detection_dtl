# Real-time Violence Detection

This project implements a real-time violence detection system using deep learning. The system can process video input and detect violent activities in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time video processing
- Deep learning-based violence detection
- Pre-trained model support
- Easy-to-use interface

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main application:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Model Files

The project uses pre-trained models for violence detection. Due to size limitations, model files (*.h5) are not included in the repository. Please contact the maintainers for access to the model files.

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for a list of Python dependencies.
